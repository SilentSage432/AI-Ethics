# FairAI Coalition – Regulating the Black Box

### English 102 Advocacy Microsite

This repo hosts the “FairAI Coalition” website, a four-page advocacy experience that argues for regulating racial bias in AI across hiring, healthcare, and criminal justice. It was designed for Tyson Zaugg’s ENG 102 Lesson 14 project.

## 🌌 Experience Highlights

- Dark blue / violet–teal gradient aesthetic with sacred-geometry motifs, glowing accents, and neural-network textures.
- Fully responsive single-page app with anchored navigation for four required “pages”:
  1. Home / About FairAI Coalition (hero + mission + MLA citations)
  2. Introduction & History
  3. Extent of the Problem & Repercussions
  4. Short-Term Band-Aid Fixes + Long-Term Visionary Solutions
- Tailwind CSS via CDN, Space Grotesk + Inter typography, and AOS-powered scroll animations.
- Embedded YouTube testimony, custom flowchart, timeline, bar chart, and high-impact imagery.
- Two QR codes linking to real-world references (Obermeyer study + EU AI Act).

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SilentSage432/AI-Ethics.git
cd AI-Ethics

# open the site
open index.html   # macOS
# or
xdg-open index.html  # Linux

Since everything is in a single HTML file with CDN assets, no build step is required.
